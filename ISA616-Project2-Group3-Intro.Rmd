## Audience and Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide information on the relationship between number of internships a student completes and salary after graduation to FSB Career Services. We will use information provided from an FSB survey to control for other student characteristics and focus on the impact of internships. This will help them give more accurate guidance to students to ensure they get the best full time opportunity for them.
